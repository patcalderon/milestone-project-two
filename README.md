# Milestone Project Two: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

## Demo
A live demo can be found at https://patcalderon.github.io/milestone-project-two/

## What is it?
It's a website created using Interactive Frontend Development. I chose to build a website where you can plan your trips within some of my favourite countries that I've personally visited.

## UX
My goal was to make the design appealing to the eye and easy to navigate through. The colors I chose were colors that I feel would fit perfect for the kind of website I wanted to make. Matching different shades of blue through the whole page.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (4.1.3)
* Google Maps API
* jQuery

## Features
The navigation style I chose to use was a single page navigation. I didn't it necessary to have more than one page on my application. This allows for a userfriendly experience on this site. 

## Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add better UX to the section between the map and the footer. Probably hide the white space and make it appear in a hover type of way.

## Testing
This site was tested mostly in DevTools in Google Chrome, but also across other browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer. The website was created on a design made by wireframe diagrams using Balsamiq. And also on mobile and tablet devices (iPhone 7 Plus, 8, iPad Pro with Safari) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. When testing I realized that social media links at the bottom of the footer were placed too much to the left when viewed in a mobile. In that way I could see what the problem was and solved it with some help from DevTools.


## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The link to the demo is at the top, or you can deploy it here: https://patcalderon.github.io/milestone-project-two/

## Credits
Content
The About section uses text from Dave's Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_(rapper)

## Media
The website uses of the Google Maps API to search for all different places displayed on the map. Google Images, that includes the background images from every section and also the ones used above the song listed on the Music section. And it is also where found the logo I used in the navbar. The songs are linked to Spotify and the video is from YouTube.

## Acknowledgements
The website default look is inspired by: https://benhasselgren.github.io/ifd-milestone-project-pages/ I put my own twist to it using my own personal touch.
Owonikoko Oluwaseun gave some great input and ideas when it came to the UX and the comments in my code.
I found some cool ideas how to manipulate the Google Maps API with the help of this channel on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb
