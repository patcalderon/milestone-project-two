# Milestone Project Two: Interactive Frontend Development - Code Institute

## Demo
A live demo can be found at https://patcalderon.github.io/milestone-project-two/

## What is it?
It's a web application created using Interactive Frontend Development. I chose to build a website where you can plan your trips within some of my favourite countries that I've personally visited.

## UX
My goal was to make the design appealing to the eye and easy to navigate through. Ideally to understand what the application does pretty much right away, and to ensure that I also added steps for how to use it on the bottom of the page. The colors I chose were colors that I feel would fit perfect for the kind of website I wanted to make. Matching different shades of blue through the whole page.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap (4.1.3)
* Google Maps API
* jQuery

## Features
The navigation style I chose to use was a single page navigation. I didn't find it necessary to have more than one page on my application. This allows for a userfriendly experience on this site. 

## Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add better UX to the section between the map and the footer. Probably hide the white space and make it appear in a hover type of way.

## Testing
This site was tested mostly in DevTools in Google Chrome, but also across other browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer. The website was created on a design made by wireframe diagrams using Balsamiq and also Figma wich was used for better visual ideas. And also on mobile and tablet devices (iPhone 7 Plus, 8, iPad Pro with Safari) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. When testing I realized that the map disappeared when viewed in a mobile. In that way I could see what the problem was and solved it with some help from DevTools.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The link to the demo is at the top, or you can deploy it here: https://patcalderon.github.io/milestone-project-two/

## Media
The website uses of the Google Maps API to search for all different places on the map.

## Acknowledgements
The website default look is inspired by: https://benhasselgren.github.io/ifd-milestone-project-pages/ I put my own twist to it using my own personal touch.
Owonikoko Oluwaseun gave some great input and ideas when it came to the UX and the comments in my code.
I found some cool ideas how to manipulate the Google Maps API with the help of this channel on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb
